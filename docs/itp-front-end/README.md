# Front-end Development Workshop (2019)

Welcome to front-end development workshop! This workshop is designed for creative students with basic understanding of coding at [ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp).


## Goal

**ðŸ‘‰ Learn the skills to build a static website from scratch**

Hopefully, by learning practical front-end development skill, one would have the ability to build a customized website to showcase projects, thoughts and more works with efficiency and uniqueness. Therefore, the main goal here is to learn basic techniques of front-end development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript and workflow. Aside from the stack, since it's almost impossible to escape from using Git and terminal, the other important goal of this workshop is getting familiar and confident at using them.


## Method

**ðŸ‘‰ Build and deploy a website with collaborators on GitHub**

There's no better way to learn code than getting our hands dirty, and that's what we're gonna do in this workshop.

The final deliverable here is a **deployed website built from scratch** without any help from template generators. We learn how to code HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how to run them as a bundle through the process of building this website.

It's important to get familiar with Git, which is the minimum requirement of team front-end and general coding project workflow. Therefore, participants of the workshop are recommended to get help and help others by **collaborating on GitHub**. In this collaboration relationship, it's inevitable to have experience of version conflicts and negotiations, which is the fastest way to learn Git.

To achieve the goal, we'll focus on these following topics:

1. Conquer your terminal
2. Collaborate on [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/)
3. Basic front-end stack
	- `HTML`
	- `CSS`
	- `JavaScript`
4. Front-end development workflow
5. Deploy your site

## üë©‚Äçüíª Exercise

#### 1. UI design modulization:

- **Goal:**

	Try to separate the UI design of your website based on the [Atomic principle](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/), and give names to each components based on [BEM principle](http://getbem.com/naming/).

- **Deliverable:** Export the outcome of modulization and namings of UI design as documentation, and push the document onto your own GitHub repo.

#### 2. HTML and CSS development:

- **Goal:**

	Build basic interface by focusing on stylings (`HTML` and `CSS`) as much as you can. User interactions (`JavaScript`) can be ignored for now. Basic folder structure of the project should be like:

	```
	root folder of your project
	|	README.md
	|	.gitignore
	|	index.html
	|
	| -- style
	|	|
	|	| style.css
	|
	| -- js
	|	|
	|	| script.js
	```

- **Deliverable:** Try to publish the repo by using [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages).

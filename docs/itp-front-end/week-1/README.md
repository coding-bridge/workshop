## üë©‚Äçüíª Exercise

### Modulization and development of UI design

There's two parts of this week's exercise:

1. **UI design modulization:**

	- **Goal:**

		Try to separate the UI design of your website based on the [Atomic principle](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/), and give names to each components based on [BEM principle](http://getbem.com/naming/). Note that there's no absolute right way to modulize an interface, and naming components could be hard at first. Just do it in the way that makes sense to you.

	- **Deliverable:**

		- Export the outcome of modulization and namings of UI design as documentation, which could `pdf`, `jpeg`, `Google Doc` or any formats preferred.
		- Push the document onto your own GitHub repo.
		- Challenge:
			1. Try to follow the [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) to `fork` [front-end-workshop-2019](https://github.com/coding-bridge/front-end-workshop-2019) repo.
			2. Add the link of your work in `week 1` section and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to origin repo (front-end-workshop-2019).

2. **HTML and CSS development:**

	- **Goal:**

		Build basic interface by focusing on stylings (`HTML` and `CSS`) as much as you can. User interactions (`JavaScript`) can be ignored for now. Few notes here:

		1. Use `Python` local server or other options you prefer to run the bundle. If Python version is 3.X, the command is `python3 -m http.server`; if it's 2.X, the command is `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. More information [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server).

		2. Basic folder structure of the project should be like:
			```
			root folder of your project
			|	README.md
			|	.gitignore
			|	index.html
			|
			| -- style
			|	|
			|	| style.css
			|
			| -- js
			|	|
			|	| script.js
			```

	- **Deliverable:**

		- Try to configure and publish the repo by using [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages).

		- Challenge:
			1. Try to follow the [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) to `fork` [front-end-workshop-2019](https://github.com/coding-bridge/front-end-workshop-2019) repo.
			2. Add the link of your work in `week 1` section and create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to origin repo (front-end-workshop-2019).

# Workshop deliverable

*Latest modified: March 23*

## ðŸŽ¯ Deployed static website

As mentioned in [introduction page](itp-front-end/README.md), the way to learn front-end development in this workshop is to build and deploy a static website. To deliver this site, in addition to technical skills that will be covered in the workshops, there's some details and information participants should know to get ready for it.

### Required materials

#### 1. Idea of the website to build

To get motivated to learn, participant comes with an idea of a website to build in this workshop. The idea could be:

 1. a showcase for one of the project you're building for a class,
 2. your own portfolio site,
 3. redesign of a legacy site, ITP Help for example,
 4. and more.

The idea could be ambitious, but it's recommended to scale it down to a static 2 to 4 pages project for this workshop.

Note that because it's not an UI/UX design workshop, participant is required to **prepare the design of the site** on your own, though we'll cover some crucial design principle related to front-end development. If designing a website from scratch is too much work, consider referencing existing website layout with **clear statement saying it's for reference and practice purpose**. For example, build a site programmatically based on the layout of your [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) portfolio site with clear statement would be an option.

The workshop will cover the topics that's in intersection of UI design and front-end development, including grid system, components, responsive web design and more. The discussion of UI/UX questions is also welcomed in the discussion part of the workshops.


#### 2. Personal laptop with required softwares

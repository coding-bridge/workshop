# CodingBridge


## History

CodingBridge was the final project created in [Open Source Studio at ITP](https://github.com/Open-Source-Studio-at-ITP) in 2018. The project was designed to be a supplementary learning resource to the syllabus of foundation course [ICM](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2018) at ITP. The goal of this project was to build supplementary programming tutorial for visual and kinesthetic learner.

## Current State

There's unfortunately no clear future road map for this project at this moment. However, since there's a series of front-end development workshops hosted in [ITP](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) community, CodingBridge will serve as a hub to organize resources, materials and deliverables.
